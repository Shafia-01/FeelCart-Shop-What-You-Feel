# 🛒 FeelCart – Shop What You Feel

**An AI-Powered shopping assistant that personalizes Walmart shopping using real-time mood detection and smart cart automation**

FeelCart is an intelligent, dual-module shopping system that enhances user experience by combining two independent yet powerful features:

- 🧠 **MoodCart**: Recommends products based on how you feel using mood classification and sentiment-aware mapping.
- 🤖 **AutoCart**: Automatically fills your cart with frequently bought, trending, or refill-needed items based on past user behavior and smart logic.

Together, these modules redefine shopping personalization — one based on **emotions**, and the other based on **habits**.

---

## 🌟 Key Modules

### 🧠 MoodCart – Shop by Emotion
- Detects the user's mood using Natural Language Processing.
- Maps mood to relevant product categories (e.g., *happy → party supplies*).
- Fetches product recommendations in real time using Walmart’s SerpAPI.
- Stores user mood history and visualizes mood trends over time.

### 🤖 AutoCart – Shop by Behavior
- Analyzes past user purchases and refill patterns.
- Identifies top-used or trending items based on frequency and category.
- Automatically fills a smart cart with personalized essentials.
- Encourages sustainable shopping with refill reminders and item prioritization.

> 💡 Both modules work **independently** and can be used based on user preference.

## 💼 Use Cases

- 😌 **Emotion Shopping**: Feeling sad? Get suggestions for comfort items like snacks, candles, or books.
- ⏰ **Routine Shopping**: Low on groceries? AutoCart identifies what you need and adds it to your cart.
- 📈 **Mood Insights**: Visualize how your moods change over time and how they influence your shopping behavior.

## 🧠 How Each Module Works

### MoodCart
1. User enters mood in plain text.
2. NLP model classifies mood → maps it to product categories.
3. Products are fetched using SerpAPI → shown to the user.
4. Mood and timestamp are saved to the database for future insights.

### AutoCart
1. Reads past purchases from `user_history.json` or database.
2. Identifies frequently bought items or those due for refill.
3. Fetches updated product data and auto-generates a personalized cart.
